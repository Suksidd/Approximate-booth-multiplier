# Approximate-booth-multiplier

An arithmetic processor's speed and power dissipation are both affected by the multiplier. Many algorithms, such as classification and recognition in data processing, do not necessarily need precise results. 

Furthermore, due to human perceptual limits, many mistakes do not make a visible impact in applications such as image processing. Approximate multipliers have been advocated by error-tolerant algorithms and applications to trading off accuracy for speed, implementation area, and power efficiency.

For the booth multiplier algorithm, we used four different ways in this research. The results of a behavioural and structural model of the precise and approximate booth multiplier have been cross-checked. In the exact booth multiplier, a new feature has been added: we have not utilised the 4-2 compressor in our implementation.
